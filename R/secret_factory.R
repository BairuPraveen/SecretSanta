#' generate proteins with alternative translation start sites
#' turn individual function generation into function factory?
#' write a basic function to generate a generic wrapper for 
#' a command line tool
#' @param method we want to use
#' @param specs for input
#' @param paths where to get the tool

secret_factory <- function(){
    # 1. validate inputs based on tool name
    
    # 2. check size of the input 
    
    # 3. simple method + parser
    
    # 4. parallel method for large iputs:
    #   run simple method in parallel and return combined result
}

# do I need to split these 4 into 4 different factory/closure functions?
# how to generate docs? when to generate function? how to deal with environment# s?
